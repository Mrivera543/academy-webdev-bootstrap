# Web Development Bootstrap

This repository contains some of the 9elements best practices for front-end web development.
Gulp is mainly used for task automation like copying assets or precompiling scss into css. For all
available tasks please consult gulp/tasks. Webpack is used for writing structured JavaScript.
Together with Babel the ES6 module syntax can be used to write next generation JavaScript apps.

### Tools we are using

  - [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (as build tool)
  - [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) as preprocessing tool for JavaScript
  - ES6 via [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

## Changelog

  - Removed Ruby stack since it's not needed for frontend dev anymore.
  - Removed CoffeeScript in favour of ES6 via Babel.
  - Removed browserify in favour of webpack.
